# Zombie Simulation

This project that, when given initial susceptible and infected populations, simulates the spread of a zombie infection on an isolated island over a period of time. This project was at its incepton based on an SIR model but was turned into a more probabilistic model over time.

## Requirements

- Python 3.5+
- Matplotlib

## Installation

If not already installed, download and install python
> *[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)*

Install Matplotlib with pip (via command line):
> pip install matplotlib

Install Pygame with pip (via command line):
> pip install pygame

After installation, both packages may be imported like any python module:
> import matplotlib  
import pygame

For this simulation, they will already have been imported in the files you download.

## Usage

Be sure the config, functions and Simulation-v5 files are in the same directory.  
Double click the Simulation-v5 file to run the simulation.
